### Notes

To run solution:

```
go run main.go
```

To run tests:

```
go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
go test
```

This solution uses the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to generate all of the primes up to a given value. This is more efficient than the solution in my [first attempt](../20161205-1-go)
